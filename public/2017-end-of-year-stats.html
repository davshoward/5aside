		<h2>2017 End of year Stats</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>This year saw the first match played away from Withdean, at Manor Road in Whitehawk.</li>
			<li><em>24</em> players played in total in 2017, an increase over 2015 and 2016's total of <em>18</em>.</li>
			<li>Sam retained <em>1st</em> place from last year, with <em>70pts</em> - a lead of <em>10</em> - but just 1 more than last year's total.</li>
			<li>Strangely, Sam finished with the exact same goal difference as last year: <em>56</em>.</li>
			<li>Rob notched a second <em>3rd</em> place finish, whilst Dan improved from <em>4th</em> last year to <em>2nd</em> in 2017.</li>
			<li>Andy took the top spot for attendance, with an <em>89%</em> attendance record (not enough to beat last year's impressive <em>95%</em> attendance from Chris and Davs).</li>
			<li>The points per game league was narrowly won by Sam <em>(P39)</em>, on 1.79 PPG. Kris <em>(P21)</em> and Mike <em>(P17)</em> sit 0.03 PPG behind in joint second place. Alex <em>(P10)</em> took 4th place and Dan <em>(P38)</em> took 5th with 1.58.</li>
			<li>Chris had the biggest consecutive streak of the year, beginning at the start of the year and finishing on 12th June - a total of <em>17</em> appearences.</li>
			<li>This year saw a marginal decrease in goal difference per game, at <em>3.44</em>, down from  <em>3.67</em> in 2016.</li>
